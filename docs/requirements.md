## Requirements:

The new site should:

- Work on desktops, tablets, and phones.

- Have a landing page.

- Have an about page.

- Have a page for the Constitution.

- Have a page for viewing news from Facebook/Twitter, as well as events from Liberland Calendar.

- Have a page for viewing Liberland's finances.

- Have a page to get contact info for Liberland and Liberland's offices.

That is it. We may, after this, add in:

- A way to register a new account.

- A way to log in.

- A way to update/view your info.

- A way to purchase merits.

For now, until all of the above is done, we will be ignoring the forums.

The desktop layout will stay the same. On tablets, the top bar should turn into a side bar. On phones, this side bar should collapse (swipe in/out).

The new site should also be able to be used for the next 5 years. Of course, as time progresses, needs will change. Hopefully we have a way to view our citizenships, not just apply. We should be able to do this via Express routers and Pug files though. The frameworks used and the layout of the site should remain.
