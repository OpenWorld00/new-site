## NodeJS/JS Style/Convention Guide:

- We have jQuery. Use it.

- Put all your requires at the top of the file.

- Use 4 spaces for tabs which should be SOFT.

- Declare 1 variable per line.

- If inlining an object with multiple properties, put it on multiple lines with each line being indented in once.

- Always leave a trailing new line at the end of a file.

- Use === and !==.

- Use () => {} notation for callbacks (unless the function is used by multiple things; in that case, just make a proper function).

- Put opening brackets on the same line.

- Use double quotes when possible.

- Use semicolons.

- Use lowerCamelCase for everything but objects and constants, which use UpperCamelCase and UPPERCASE, respectively.

- Use async/await wherever possible.
