# Liberland's (soon-to-be) Official Site

This is the repository for Liberland's new site. Upon completion, it will be put up on [liberland.org](https://liberland.org).

We invite the community to help and contribute. We're looking for people who know Node, JavaScript, Express, Pug, SCSS, and more. We also don't need just coders but need some translators too! People who do make accepted contributions will receive merits for their work.

If you're questioning why someone would work for just merits, it's because it's not just merits. It's a chance to demonstrate the advantages of modern technology. It's a chance for the community to build the best site they can for the community. It's a chance to be able to say "I worked on the website of a nation."

Also, do not submit code that doesn't work or break something else.

## Running the code:

Download the code and enter the root folder. After editing "/settings.json"...

`npm i`

`cd ./node_modules/geoip`

`npm run-script updatedb`

`cd ../../`

`node main.js`

## Payment:

Payment will only be made in merits.

The payment for coders is based on accepted amount of unique lines of code (not comments, blank lines or one line applied to ten files). The Repository's managers will condense code if it's expanded and remove redundant code if it's added in. Do not try to cheat the system.

Currently, the going rate for coders is 1 merit per 2 lines of code.

The Constitution files are not eligible for payment due to their immense size, along with text that's from this repository. If a line is less than ten characters (ignoring text and blank space), it will be added to the character count of the next line (and not counted in the line count).

## Discord:

The team and contributors discuss on a discord server. If you want to know how you can help and talk with people working on the site, join us! We'll be happy to talk to you and help you get started on helping us. [Click here to join.](https://discord.gg/SsFcuTZ)
